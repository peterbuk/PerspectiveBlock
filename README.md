# PerspectiveBlock
Undergraduate Research Project: Sharing Perspective in Remote Collaborative AR

---

Augmented reality provides an intuitive way to work with 3D models because of the natural mapping 
to our physical movement and the benefits of AR technology. However, it does not easily support 
remote collaboration due to difficulties in communicating spatial and contextual information. 
We investigate this problem by introducing the Perspective Block, a novel handheld interaction tool. 
This block has an embedded camera and sensors that can be used to capture important perspective 
information such as contextual location and video feeds. By using this block, collaborators will be 
able to share their perspective with each other using a variety of interaction techniques, allowing 
for more natural communication. These interaction techniques were evaluated through an informal study 
in order to gather feedback on their effectiveness and potential of use in a real world context.
